# 3x3x3RubiksCubeRobot
*Fully Autonomous Rubik's Cube solving robot*

# Warning:
This code base was developed before I knew how to write proper code. As such, it is terrible and I strongly advise not looking through it.


## Algorithm
Version 3 of the rubik's cube solving algorithm can be found in RubiksCubeV3/RubiksCubeV3/Program.cs.
