# 3x3x3RubiksCubeRobot
*Fully Autonomous Rubik's Cube solving robot*

## Algorithm
Version 3 of the rubik's cube solving algorithm can be found in RubiksCubeV3/RubiksCubeV3/Program.cs. 
Warning: The code was not developed using proper software engineering principles and as such is very challenging to read. (This is due to it being developed years ago)
